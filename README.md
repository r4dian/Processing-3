# Processing 3 Sketches

Updated sketches for processing v3 from the follwoing repos :

- https://github.com/GlitchTools/ASDFPixelSort
( ASDFPixelSort )
- https://github.com/GlitchTools/Introwerks
( colorcrusher, diagonalGlitch, grid1_0*, introwaves, lineGlitch, randomBlocks, ruttetraEmulator, subtleSorting, vmap )
- https://github.com/bobvk/sketches
( auecho, crtdots, cubed, cubemap, dripdrip, echo, eyestrain2, kromachey, multicubes, mware, phaser, vhs, wahwah, yade, zigzag )

*grid1_0 has not been updated yet as the required lib "gifAnimation" is not updated for v3 yet.

Mostly just moving stuff from setup() that is now required to be in settings() (good naming scheme there, not confusing at all...)
