Processing 3 Sketches
=====================

Updated sketches for Processing v3 from the following repos :

- https://github.com/GlitchTools/ASDFPixelSort
( ASDFPixelSort )
- https://github.com/GlitchTools/Introwerks
( colorcrusher, diagonalGlitch, grid1_0*, introwaves, lineGlitch, randomBlocks, ruttetraEmulator, subtleSorting, vmap )
- https://github.com/bobvk/sketches
( auecho, crtdots, cubed, cubemap, dripdrip, echo, eyestrain2, kromachey, multicubes, mware, phaser, vhs, wahwah, yade, zigzag )

*grid1_0 has not been updated yet as the required lib "gifAnimation" is not updated for v3 yet.

Mostly just making sure they follow the rule `Do not use variables in size()` - [source](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0)
